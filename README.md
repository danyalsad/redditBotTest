RedditBotTest
=============

A basic Reddit bot that pulls the 'hot' posts from [/r/aww](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/) every hour and reposts them to a [private sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RCBRedditBot/).

To modify, you'll need to register an application on [Reddit's Dev page](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps) Then, add your clientId, clientSecret, username, and password to a config.js file in the root of the app.

The app uses [snoowrap](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap) for accessing Reddit's API.
